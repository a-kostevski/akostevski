## Hello!

I'm a software engineer who enjoys building things that work well and last. My interests span across backend development, infrastructure automation, and creating tools that make developers' lives easier.

When I'm not writing code, you'll find me:

- Tinkering with my **homelab** setup
- Contributing to **open-source** projects
- Writing about things I've learned
- Exploring new technologies

## This Site

This site serves as my digital garden - a place to share articles, notes, and project documentation. It's built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using a custom theme I created called **flavor**.

Feel free to explore and reach out if you'd like to connect!
